            <p>
                I'm a junior studying Computer Science. I've recently finished a SWE internship at Capital One, where I was able to develop
                an impactful and interesting project, and now I'm looking for Summer'23 internship opportunities where I can continue
                take responsibility and ownership of my work.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to school, I like to work on projects. I've developed full stack apps deployed on the AWS cloud. Right now, 
                I've been interested in lower level languages such as C/C++ to understand what's going on under the hood in applications.
            </p>

        </article>
